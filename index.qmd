:::{#hero-heading}

I'm a graduate student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, where I used text-as-data methods to better understand the Supreme Court. I have a strong background in statistics, with an emphasis on machine learning, imbalanced data, and text-analysis. 

When not messing around with text-as-data measures, I like making playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/x5xyifk4f697kabe2mm1u95p5?si=972ccc2d5bca40cd), reviewing movies I've watched on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/PeterJBachman/), and reviewing games I've played on [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/PeterJBachman/).

#### I am looking for a job!

- You can find my resume [here](resume/index.qmd). I currently reside in St. Louis, MO.
