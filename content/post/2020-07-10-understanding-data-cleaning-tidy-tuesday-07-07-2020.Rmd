I love learning R. The language clicks with me, and I love understanding new methods to clean and manipulate data. Issues arise when I try and read code on how others clean data. So this post/series of posts may be more for my benefit alone, but I want to take code from outside sources and break down how they manipulate and clean their data. To start this, I'm taking a simpler code from the "Tidy Tuesday" Github repository (found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)), since they post simple code to clean the data for basic analysis.
