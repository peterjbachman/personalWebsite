# Welcome

I'm Peter, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Utah State University.
I expect to receive a B.A. in Political Science in Spring 2021, with minors in
Japanese and Statistics.

I'm currently applying for PhD programs, and hope to become a professor at a
university. My research interests include voter turnout and behavior,
communication methods, manipulation tactics, text as data, and political
institutions.
