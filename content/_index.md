I'm a recent Master's graduate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, where I used text-as-data methods to better understand the Supreme Court. I have a strong background in statistics, regression analysis, bayesian modeling, natural language processing, and causal inference.

When not messing around with data, I like making playlists on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/x5xyifk4f697kabe2mm1u95p5?si=972ccc2d5bca40cd), reviewing movies I've watched on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/PeterJBachman/), and reviewing games I've played on [Backloggd](https://www.backloggd.com/u/PeterJBachman/).
