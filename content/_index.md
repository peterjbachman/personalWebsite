I'm currently a PhD student in Political Science at Washington University in St.
Louis. My research interests include text as data, judicial politics, and
campaign messaging. I generally enjoy taking qualitative research and finding
ways to quantify that research.


I am also interested in anything that I would get paid 6 figures to research.
