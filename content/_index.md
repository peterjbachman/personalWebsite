Hi and welcome to my website!

I'm Peter, and I'm currently an undergraduate student at Utah State University. I expect to receive a B.A. in Political Science this coming spring.

I'm currently applying for PhD programs, and hope to become a professor at a
university. My research interests include voter turnout, voter behavior, mass
communication, manipulation tactics, and political psychology.
