I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis.
My research interests include judicial politics, textual analysis, and political communication.
I enjoy taking qualitative research and finding ways to quantify that research.

I will also have an interest in anything I would get paid 6 figures to research.
