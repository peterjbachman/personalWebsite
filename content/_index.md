# Welcome

I'm Peter, and I graduated with a B.A. in Political Science from Utah State
University in Spring of 2021, with minors in Japanese and Statistics.

I'm going to be attending Washington University in St. Louis starting in Fall
2021. My research interests include voter turnout and behavior,
communication methods, manipulation tactics, text as data, and political
institutions.
