## Link Recommendations

Inspired by [this blog](https://michaelhans.com/eclecticism/link-recommendations/), which was inspired by [this toot](https://hackers.town/@lori/112315199079217074). Funny how these things work exactly the way the original poster intended.

A collection of links, books, podcasts and the sort, hand curated by me. I may categorize these at some point, but for now they are in alphabetical order.

- [Anthology of the Killer](https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer): I really can't stop thinking about these games. Comedy + Horror. And I love seeing the games develop and increase in complexity over the series.
- [brr](https://brr.fyi/): A nice series of blog posts from someone who worked in Antarctica for roughly 1.5 years.
- [Buried Treasure](https://buried-treasure.org/): Just the nicest reviews of games I've never heard of. Do I pick most of them up? No. But it puts things on my radar that I otherwise wouldn't have known.
- [Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online/): A very positive video game podcast sometimes talking about recent releases but mostly about whatever games they've been playing recently.
- [Piranesi](https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/piranesi-9781635577808/): Just a lovely book by Susanna Clarke about a man stuck in a house with infinite walls and corridors.
- [Plain Text Sports](https://plaintextsports.com/): Live sports scores in plain text. You love to see it.
- [When you browse Instagram and find former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's passport number](https://mango.pdf.zone/finding-former-australian-prime-minister-tony-abbotts-passport-number-on-instagram): One of the funniest stories about how someone found way too much information about the former prime minister through a series of "hacks".
