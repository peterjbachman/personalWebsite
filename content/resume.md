## Research Experience

**Washington University in St. Louis**
*Supreme Court Justicesâ€™ Accusations of Judicial Activism in Separate Opinions* | 2023 - 2024

- [Paper](/files/third_year_paper.pdf)

- Classified Supreme Court Opinions using machine learning techniques (**LLM** fine-tuning, **XGBoost**) to measure the concept of judicial activism, remedying low classification performance through undersampling and threshold adjustment.
- Employed a two-stage selection model to account for selection bias when representing how justices use judicial activism in separate opinions.
- Coordinated and managed 7 undergraduate students in hand-labeling Supreme Court opinions.

*Do Daughters Affect How Judges Interpret Law?* | 2023

- [Replication Code](https://github.com/peterjbachman/causal_project) and [Poster](/files/causal_project.pdf)

- Accessed federal circuit court opinion text using **Python** to access the Caselaw Access Project's API.
- Employed a Structural Topic Model to find when judges discussed first-hand accounts in case opinions.
- Utilized causal inference techniques through generalized full matching across judge and case-level characteristics.

*Research Assistant to Taylor Carlson*\
*Through the Grapevine: Socially Transmitted Information and Distorted Democracy* | 2023

- Ensured the validity of results in the book by creating replication code files in **R**.
- Created figures using **ggplot2** to convey the importance of socially transmitted information using survey data.

*Research Assistant to Taylor Carlson*\
*An Era of Minimal Exposure but Not-So-Minimal Effects? The Case of Fox News* | 2023

- Managed a **SQL** database, making queries on a database with over 32 million Twitter posts.

- Created reports using **ggplot2** to represent how survey participants engage in Fox News across multiple data sources.

*Improving Measures of Emotion in Judicial Text using 
Word Embeddings* | 2023

- [Replication Code](https://github.com/peterjbachman/judicialEmbedding) and [Poster](/files/judicialembeddings.pdf)

- Collected text of Supreme Court opinions by accessing the CourtListener API using **Python**.
- Utilized GLoVe word embeddings to measure how the cosine similarity of words in Supreme Court opinions relates to frequently used sentiment analysis dictionaries.
