If you know me, you know I grew up Mormon. And the Mormon faith comes with a whole slew of preconceptions, some of which are positive!

But [so](https://apnews.com/article/mormon-church-sexual-abuse-investigation-e0e39cf9aa4fbe0d8c1442033b894660) [many](https://www.codyenterprise.com/news/local/article_42647158-355b-11ee-b6e8-f3e1726f834b.html) [issues](https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/2023/recordings-show-mormon-church-protects-itself-from-child-sex-abuse-claims/) [keep](https://apnews.com/article/mormonism-us-securities-and-exchange-commission-religion-business-a598c9ef9544f57e0b60d5ca80774bf7) [coming](https://www.truthandtransparency.org/news/2022/04/05/lds-church-has-most-valuable-private-real-estate-portfolio-in-the-us-evidence-suggests/) [up](https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2024/03/19/will-black-students-case-byu/), [and](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2022/03/10/new-employment-policy/) [I](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2024/03/15/byu-will-require-incoming-students/) [cannot](https://floodlit.org/) [ignore](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2023/11/24/slap-face-lds-relief-society/) [them](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/amp/culture/story/david-archuleta-details-faith-crisis-coming-mormon-church-93505214). Day after day I see Mormonism take one small step forward and two big steps backwards. I cannot find the strength to support an organization that (while they don't condone these actions) allows these bad things to keep happening.

To be sure, Mormonism does many great things! My local ward is a great example of how a religious group can bring together a diverse group of people, and help the local community. But I do not believe the local actions of a congregation equates global repentance of the religion. Because of this my spirituality is undergoing a metamorphosis.

In this time I've gravitated towards tarot cards. No, not for diving the future, but to give me the opportunity to practice self-care and personal growth[^1]. In this way, the tarot cards provide different perspectives on how to approach situations, depending on the card pulled.

The cards are split into two distinct parts, the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. There are 22 cards in the Major Arcana, starting from the *The Magician*, ending with *The World*, and *The Fool* being "unnumbered". The numbered cards symbolize a path towards spiritual self-awareness as traveled by *The Fool*. *The Fool* is portrayed as the protagonist of this journey, often appearing at the beginning or end of this sequence.

In this way I feel like *The Fool* at both ends of the sequence. While my spiritual journey with Mormonism may be nearing its end, a new spiritual journey is beginning. I am excited to walk this new path, making foolish mistakes and learning along the way.
