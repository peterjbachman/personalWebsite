Hello.

I was listening to [Search Engine](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/how-do-i-use-the-internet-now) earlier this month.
Great show, they cover diverse topics from airport coffee to the rise of amphetamines.
In the episode linked above one of the people mentions writing a small newsletter for those close to him.
Something about writing for those who have a genuine interest in their life.

This is my attempt of doing something similar.
I hope you enjoy hearing about whatever is on my mind.
Sometimes deeply personal thoughts, at other times an attempt to explain incoherent ideas.

I aim to make this worth reading.
Once(ish) a month discussing thoughts or events in my sphere of influence.

It will be fun.

There's a beautifully written series called [Altar Bound](https://web.archive.org/web/20231013230349/https://homeculture.substack.com/p/altar-bound-79c).[^1]
It covers instances of abuse within the LDS Church, not pulling punches at all.
Reading the second part clicked some things in my head I had known but thought about individually.

[^1]: If you can support Meg Conley's work you should. It's a shame the article is behind a paywall now.

I frequently think about what kind of world I want my (eventual) kids to live in.
