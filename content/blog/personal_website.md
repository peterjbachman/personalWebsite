Hey.

You're probably here because you wanna know how to set up a personal website.

That's great!

We're gonna start with the most simple version of this, using R and `blogdown` to make a GitHub Pages website, and then layer on some complexity, including different places to host your site, and adding a domain name.

## Blogdown

If you are familiar with R and R Markdown, then [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is a great place to start. This allows you to create new pages on a website using RMarkdown files. The added bonus here is that you can use R code to make more dynamic webpages (for example, if you want to do some data analysis on an ever-growing dataset).

- Static Site Generator
- Install blogdown
- Set up a public github repository
- Setting up Netlify
- rbind
- custom domain
- cloudflare
- 

```
install.packages("blogdown")
```

test adding some text here to see if signing works on my linux setup.
